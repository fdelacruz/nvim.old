# Neovim from scratch

**IMPORTANT** Requires [Neovim v0.6.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.6.0) or [Nightly](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly). 
## Install Neovim (Homebrew)
```
brew install neovim
```
Or install the development version
```
brew install --HEAD luajit
brew install --HEAD neovim
```
**NOTE** In case neovim install fails
```
brew uninstall neovim
brew uninstall --force libvterm (or brew unlink libvterm)
brew install --HEAD neovim 
```
In order to upgrade neovim
```
brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD neovim
```
## Try out this config

Make sure to remove or move your current `nvim` directory

```
git clone https://github.com/fdelacruz/Neovim-from-scratch.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Run `nvim` and wait for the plugins to be installed 

**NOTE** (You will notice treesitter pulling in a bunch of parsers the next time you open Neovim) 

## Get healthy

Open `nvim` and enter the following:

```
:checkhealth
```

You'll probably notice you don't have support for copy/paste also that python and node haven't been setup

So let's fix that

First we'll fix copy/paste

- On mac `pbcopy` should be builtin

- On Ubuntu

  ```
  sudo apt install xsel
  ```

- On Arch Linux

  ```
  sudo pacman -S xsel
  ```

Next we need to install python support (node is optional)

- Neovim python support

  ```
  pip install pynvim
  ```

- Neovim node support

  ```
  npm i -g neovim
  ```

## Fonts

- [A nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)

- [codicon](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons/raw/main/dist/codicon.ttf)
- [An emoji font](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/blob/main/fonts/NotoColorEmoji.ttf)

After moving fonts to `~/.local/share/fonts/`

Run: `$ fc-cache -f -v`

**NOTE:**

If you are seeing boxes without icons, try changing this line from `false` to `true`: [link](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/nvim/blob/ac41efa237caf3a498077df19a3f31ca4b35caf3/lua/user/icons.lua#L5)
